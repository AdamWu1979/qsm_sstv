An in-house SVD algorithm based on [Klassen](https://cds.ismrm.org/protected/13MProceedings/files/3739.PDF) and [Walsh](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/%28SICI%291522-2594%28200005%2943%3A5%3C682%3A%3AAID-MRM10%3E3.0.CO%3B2-G?sid=nlm%3Apubmed) was used to reconstruct the ME-GRE raw data. This algorithm gives the least squares best estimate of the magnetization and avoids phase singularities. QSM processing was performed as follows. Spatial phase unwrapping was accomplished using a [3D best path algorithm](https://www.osapublishing.org/captcha/?guid=DB7B22B8-A0CC-CCD4-D8F8-1EC63CD1BE61). The frequency at each voxel was then estimated by weighted least squares; each phase echo was weighted by the local SNR in the corresponding T2* image. Finally, background removal and dipole inversion were performed simultaneously using a [single-step QSM algorithm](http://martinos.org/~berkin/Chatnuntawech_2016_NMR_in_Biomed.pdf).
